          From ripples to waves: Changing the unsustainable trajectory of Hong Kong’s freshwater use

                        <h6>Though a drought is not near, Hong Kong’s lack of action regarding its wasteful use of water will leave it treading if a crisis strikes in the near future. </h6>
                        <p>The most apparent problem regarding Hong Kong’s water supply is perhaps the overconsumption on the domestic level. To get an idea of just how much water Hongkongers use on a day-to-day basis, per capita the total water usage is
                            at approximately 180 litres, which includes the seawater used for flushing at about 50 litres a day. Therefore a total of 130 litres of freshwater is used by each individual on a daily basis. Compared to neighbouring cities
                            such as Shanghai and Shenzhen, some of which use up to 15 litres less, Hong Kong is clearly the anomaly. Water is already globally scarce; only 2% of the world’s water is actually potable freshwater while Hong Kong is one of
                            the most water scarce regions on Earth, making climate change a factor that only exacerbates this already-pressing situation.</p>
                        <p>While there are too many facets in the big picture to include all of them coherently, this article plans to tackle in further detail the larger issues surrounding water sustainability in Hong Kong. It summarises Hong Kong’s freshwater
                            supply history, discusses water’s true value, and then examines the staggering amount of water that is lost annually. This report also elaborates on how Hong Kong can take advantage of water technologies along with providing
                            specific examples, followed by a closer look at Singapore as a case study that Hong Kong can model itself after when pursuing a sustainable future.</p>
                        <h6>The history of Hong Kong's freshwater supply</h6>
                        <p>Water sustainability efforts are currently at a large disadvantage in part due to the lack of public knowledge surrounding the issue. According to Dr Frederick Lee, Associate Professor at the University of Hong Kong, the reason
                            for the public lack of awareness of the city’s freshwater supply can be found within the history of Hong Kong. Since the early 1980s Hong Kong has worked under the DongShen Agreement, a water supply agreement with the Guangdong
                            region. In the present day, this river provides Hong Kong with about 80% of its freshwater, and it is as Lee says, “a political arrangement that guarantees that even if there is a major drought in the region, Hong Kong is given
                            first priority to get their water from the river basin.” The origin story of this plentiful supply that remains largely unknown to the average Hongkonger, and it is this disconnect between the citizens and the source of their
                            water that creates what Lee refers to as “a sense of complacency.” He cites a major drought that occurred in 2011, where some major cities in the Guangdong province were forced to ration water, while Hongkongers remained “insulated
                            from any impacts”, completely sheltered from the widespread water shortage in the region.</p>
                        <h6>The true value of water</h6>
                        <p>Hong Kong needs to change how it values its water because people don’t prioritise it as highly as other resources. The fact that Hong Kong is next to the water gives people the wrong impression that there is plenty of it for them
                            to use. The general public is also ignorant of the true value of water because it is heavily subsidised by the government. In the fiscal year of 1995-1996 water tariffs were frozen, and thus while the cost of water has gone
                            up over time, the fees have remained the same with citizens paying less than half of the total unit cost of production. The current system in place for freshwater leaves people completely unaware of how much water they are
                            using per month, how much the water they use is really worth, and how unsustainable the usage habits are on the large scale.</p>
                        <p>In the words of Joyce Lau, Communications Director at think tank Civic Exchange, “Your average person doesn’t know these basic facts. They don’t know the water’s imported, they don’t know the water’s heavily subsidised. You turn
                            on the tap, it comes out endlessly, it’s extremely cheap, and that’s all people know.” As a restaurant owner, Grander Water’s Kevin Tam agrees that the people simply are not being charged the fair price for water. The solution
                            to this problem seems simple: raise the tariffs on water, and people will waste less. But the reality is that such a legal proposition would cause an uproar amongst citizens and businesses alike; this reason alone is one of
                            the largest roadblocks preventing Hong Kong from becoming a water sustainable city.</p>
                        <p>An immediate concern of raised water tariffs is the negative effect it would have on the lower to middle class in Hong Kong. Lau assures that this will not be the case: “We’ve been very clear from the beginning that any tariff
                            raise cannot hurt your average working class Hong Kong family.” Hong Kong already has systems in place that ensure the lower-class would not suffer unjustly were tariff reform to occur. Civic Exchange’s recent report on this
                            subject, <i>The Illusion of Plenty: Hong Kong’s Water Security, Working Towards Regional Water Harmony</i>, states that the average household’s water bill is currently HK$48 a month; in 2015-2016 13% of Hongkongers were fully
                            subsidised for their water usage. Each individual is also allotted a generous 12 cubic metres of freshwater (approximately 20 bathtubs) for free every four months. While ensuring that any future water sustainability efforts
                            don’t negatively affect the lives of the low to middle class, there is little room for complaint considering how insignificant and highly subsidised the water bill is in comparison to other living expenses. Since households
                            with higher water usage tend to be of higher income, the idea is that the well-off should pay – at a minimum – the amount it costs the government to purchase water from China. “Water is a precious resource,” says Grander Water’s
                            Kevin Tam, “You can’t just put a price tag on it that is so little that people don’t really care. For Hong Kong it might be a valid point to increase the cost. Until your average citizen in Hong Kong can say, ‘We’re using all
                            sorts of different technologies to help save water’, increasing the price of water is the only way.’”</p>
                        <h6>One third of Hong Kong's freshwater down the drain</h6>
                        <p>Both the problems and solutions underlying Hong Kong’s water problem are not difficult to identify. The problem is that there are hefty obstacles that prevent water sustainability in Hong Kong from becoming a reality. Lee states
                            that in order for the Legislative Council to even seriously consider such reform, Hong Kong needs to get a handle of the immense amount of water loss that occurs annually from leakage in government mains and private pipes,
                            as well as theft. Together, <i>The Illusion of Plenty</i> found that up to one-third of this supply is lost, totalling to approximately HK$1.35 billion in revenue. Although the government celebrates the successes of the Total
                            Water Management (TWM) Strategy, which was an initiative begun in 2003 that reduced the amount of wastage from government pipes in the past 10 years, this is not where the efforts should stop.</p>
                        <p>Sam Inglis, Environmental Research Analyst at ADM Capital Foundation, says that while the leakage reductions of public pipes from 25% to 15% (a reduction of 10% over 15 years) are remarkable, this is only “the first phase.” “More
                            must be done,” he posits, “with private leakage certainly being made a priority.” According to Inglis, the WSD have no plans to deal with private leakage in the near future. While commendable, the work of the TWM have proven
                            to be inadequate for conservation and planning for Hong Kong’s long-term sustainability.</p>
                        <h6>Embracing water sustainable technology</h6>
                        <p>Another path of consideration to approach this dilemma is through water technologies. While strategies such as desalination are unsustainable due to the costliness of the process, there are numerous other options that are not hard
                            to adopt. There has been already a variety of water-saving systems that can be installed in upcoming building projects, as well as technologies that can be incorporated to make older buildings more sustainable. Smaller examples
                            include faucets and shower heads, which have been long available on the market, that disperse water in a way that gets the job done with less. Tam describes what he calls “a very simple technology”, where the outlet from which
                            the water flows consists of layers that chop the water forming bubbles, reducing water usage by 30% whenever someone turns on the tap. This technology uses netting that distributes the water with higher pressure and lower speed,
                            scattering the bubbled water in different directions. It successfully saves on water use without noticeably altering the experience when taking a shower or running the sink faucet. Other technology include toilets equipped
                            with a dual flush mechanism which can save on the amount of water that is flushed on a daily basis. The most effective way to take advantage of these technologies would be to have them installed in new buildings, but according
                            to Lee, these water-efficient appliances are not being made a part of these buildings’ infrastructure. That, he claims, is a strategy most likely to succeed if the government creates regulations that would administer their
                            installation.
                        </p>
                        <p>What buildings can also do to decrease the amount of water they let go to waste is by making adjustments to their water tank systems. According to Tam, thousands of buildings in Hong Kong have water tanks for commercial and domestic
                            use. When these water tanks are due for frequent cleaning, especially since Hong Kong’s geography makes these water tanks more privy to sedimentation buildup, this creates a lot of waste, as cleaning requires that the entire
                            tank is dumped out then refilled afterwards.</p>
                        <p>Grander Water is trying to ameliorate this wastage by encouraging buildings to reduce their tank cleanings to only once a year through the utilisation of Grander technology. “We can implement Grander technology into any tank, and
                            basically after you change the water once it’s going to stay clean because it actually gets all the sediment off of the tank itself.” He also claims that within four to six weeks’ time, there should be a visible improvement
                            in the water quality that is distributed from the tank. They already have two successful Grander system projects, one located at Tipco Tower in Thailand and the other at Lido Hotel in Guangzhou. The simple installation completed
                            at Lido Hotel in 2012 has completely solved many of the hotel’s problems such as sedimentation, rust, and bacteria buildup, improving the overall quality of water in the building and substantially decreasing the amount of freshwater
                            that would have been wasted from regular tank cleanings. Looking to the future, Tam hopes to eventually develop the sort of technology that would be able to make water a naturally renewable resource.</p>
                        <h6>Singapore: setting and example for Hong Kong</h6>
                        <p>Singapore is a good city to compare to Hong Kong as they share similar cityscapes and its people lead similar lifestyles as well. Despite their shared traits, Singapore has taken strides to reduce its per capita domestic water
                            consumption, having decreased it from 165 litres per day in 2003 to the current 148. They are also aiming to further reduce it by another 8 litres to 140 per capita by 2030. While they set a shining example of water sustainability,
                            the major difference that may render Singapore a difficult one to follow is that the government and its populace operate very differently from those of Hong Kong. Inglis states, “One of the things that Singapore does and has
                            done for a really long time is they have made it a national priority to emphasise the importance and value of water.” Such a strategy based on encouraging action for the sake of nationalistic pride would be futile in Hong Kong,
                            as its citizens do not share the same attitudes that are driving the water sustainability efforts in Singapore. “For Singapore,” he continues, “it’s an existential threat potentially. They have a deal with Malaysia, and because
                            they have a somewhat contentious relationship at times, they don’t want to be held over a barrel effectively if a water crisis does come about.” Hong Kong does not share this situation and therefore can only take a limited
                            amount of inspiration from Singapore.</p>
                        <p>The way in which Hong Kong should follow in Singapore’s footsteps, according to Lee, is through the maximisation of local freshwater resources. Singapore has a future plan to reduce its imports from the current 40% to 0% by 2060.
                            As of 2015, only 16.6% of Hong Kong’s freshwater comes from its public and privately owned local sources. In order to reach a point of ideal sustainability, Lee posits that the government “needs to cap and reduce” the amount
                            of water it imports from China until the city is compelled to increase its reliance on local resources. Further research needs to be conducted in order to calculate an accurate depiction of how much Hong Kong’s local resources
                            can realistically be maximised, and how much the importation of Dongjiang water can be minimised.</p>
                        <h6>Conclusion: Bridging the gap between ideas and reality</h6>
                        <p>Given all the factors at play, it is evident that there are missing pieces that need to be placed in order to administer the aforementioned solutions to better address Hong Kong’s water sustainability problem. While the public
                            needs to pressure the government to prioritise this issue in order to ensure an appropriate response, this will not happen until the government invests in massive campaigning to raise public awareness. This would then welcome
                            opportunities to legislate and enforce water-saving regulations. But before even considering tariff raises and other legislative reform, existing issues such as water wastage and leakage need to be addressed. While making Hong
                            Kong more water sustainable does not necessarily require technology we don’t already have, Hong Kong needs to make better use of creative solutions found in water technologies that are not new as far as sustainable technology
                            goes. Effective utilisation of these simple technologies would noticeably improve water usage without inconveniencing the lives of domestic consumers. In addendum, water sustainability in Hong Kong is still a young endeavour,
                            and there are still much information to uncover in order to formulate a holistic solution. Bringing all these facets together, Hong Kong will be able to pave the way to a future that ensures a harmonious relationship between
                            its water, the government, and its people.</p>

                        <h6>Three speakers discussed US-China Relations at the Asia Society Hong Kong Centre.</h6>
                        <p>For an event focusing on US-China political relations, it is no surprise that President Donald Trump was the name under the spotlight of a discussion hosted by Asia Society on 16 May. Taking place at the Asia Society Hong Kong
                            Centre’s banquet hall, the event consisted of three esteemed speakers: Charles E. Cook, Yuan Ming, and Ronnie C. Chan. These speakers spent an hour and a half engaging critical dialogue surrounding relevant topics and followed
                            up with a Q&A session to conclude the event.</p>
                        <p>Highlights from the event include discussion around the case of Trump’s anti-China political campaign, where Trump made several accusations against China prior to his presidency. Such accusations include his threat to label China
                            a currency manipulator, while he also claimed on Twitter that “[t]he concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese”. Cook raised the question as to why Trump dropped that line of dialogue after he was inaugurated
                            into the presidential position, further elaborating on its implications and what further consequences his presidency will incur in the coming future of US-China relations. Most of the night centred around Cook’s critical discussion
                            on Trump and the prospective consequences of his presidency, with Ming and Chan’s commentary relevant to the Chinese political sphere interspersed amongst the conversation.</p>
                        <p>This event was a good reminder that including audiences of all ages in political dialogue encourages the contribution of a wide variety of differing perspectives, which can then enrich discussion.</p>
                        <p>If there’s one lesson to take away from the event, it would be Ronnie Chan’s blunt statement: “China has no choice but to deal with the United States.” For the rest of Trump’s first term, China’s political leaders (along with other
                            international leaders) will have to prepare for a more volatile playing field in order to keep afloat of the currently unpredictable state of the international political sphere.</p>

                        <H6>“Sharing our achievements, but also our challenges”: The Consul General of Canada Jeff Nankivell wants the world to see Canada for all it’s worth.</H6>
                        <p>Jeff Nankivell has a lot of celebrating to do this summer. Not only is it the 150th birthday of his nation, but he is also nearing the completion of his first year as the Consul General of Canada to Hong Kong and Macao. On 21 June
                            the Consulate held its largest anniversary reception at the Island Shangri-la Hotel, where the crowd not only commemorated Canada’s milestone, but to also take in the strength of the Canadian community in Hong Kong. It is not
                            surprising that Hong Kong and Canada are so deeply intertwined on numerous levels. In fact, the designer of the Canada 150 logo is Ariana Mari Cuvin, a Hong Kong-born Canadian pursuing her undergraduate studies at the University
                            of Waterloo.</p>
                        <p>From its friendly people to free healthcare, Canada’s reputation all over the world is one that brims with positivity. Though this is the case, Nankivell says that one of the major diplomatic objectives of Canada 150 is to draw
                            attention to the important aspects of Canada that others would not know about. For example, Canada is a world leader in new and innovative fields such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and fintech. He claims that
                            there are great opportunities for collaboration amongst Hong Kong and Canadian companies that would enrich the project output as well as Hong Kong-Canadian partnerships.</p>
                        <p><i>“IN CANADA’S 150 YEAR HISTORY, AS A MODERN NATION, THERE ARE SOME MOMENTS IN OUR HISTORY OF WHICH WE ARE NOT PROUD […] THE WAY THAT [CHINESE RAILWAY] WORKERS WERE TREATED IS A PART OF OUR HISTORY THAT WE HAVE SINCE THEN WORKED TO TRY TO RECOGNISE AND VOW TO DO BETTER.”</i></p>
                        <p>Nankivell points to the confidence of Horizons Ventures, the Hong Kong-based venture capital investment fund associated with Li Ka-shing, in Canadian innovation. Horizons Ventures has invested in more than half a dozen Canadian
                            startups in fields of high tech, including Nanoleaf. Nanoleaf began in 2012 with a Kickstarter campaign for its energy-efficient LED lightbulb.</p>
                        <p>Other innovators include APrivacy, a startup based in Waterloo, Ontario. Its multi-channel digital security program enables secure communication between financial service providers and their customers over social platforms such
                            as email or Whatsapp. CEO Cédric Jeannot decided to move, along with some other senior company managers, to Hong Kong in order to take advantage of the opportunities in the city, as Hong Kong has a large number of major financial
                            institutions.</p>
                        <p><em>Work in progress: Aboriginal Reconciliation</em></p>
                        <p>Canada has a lot to be proud of in its 150 years of existence since the Confederation in 1867. Despite the positive name that Canada has made for itself on the international playing field, “there are some moments in our history
                            of which we are not proud, [such as] the treatment of the railway workers who came to Canada in the 19th century and played an essential role in building the national railway that linked the eastern provinces of Canada with
                            British Columbia in the Pacific. The way that those workers were treated is a part of our history that we have since then worked to try to recognise and we vow to do better.” Canada has vastly improved since then; after the
                            flood of Hong Kong immigrants in the 1980s to 90s, Hong Kongers have made vital contributions to all walks of Canadian life. There are presently 300,000 Canadians in Hong Kong, most of whom are Hong Kong-born individuals who
                            immigrated to Canada before returning back to develop their professional careers.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately for the First Nations, Inuit, and Métis communities, the widespread discrimination they received by the Canadian government since the country’s inception continues to persist today. At the Canada 150 Reception, Nankivell
                            raised awareness of National Aboriginal Day which coincided with the event, and discussed the importance of continuing to work on repairing the relations between Aboriginal and First Nations communities with the government.
                            He believes that it is important as Canadians that “we come prepared to talk about the things we have not done well, and to be modest and humble recognising these things and talk about what we’re doing to try to make those
                            things better. I think it’s an important contribution that we can bring into the world: that we are not only sharing our achievements, but also our challenges.”</p>
                        <p>A full reconciliation between peoples will take many years, but the government has recently developed long term initiatives that will span the next decade to address many of the struggles that First Nations communities face. “There
                            is money that is being put aside in budgets over the next decade [and] significant new investments in infrastructure in First Nations communities, [some of which] to our shame, lack reliable sources of safe drinking water.”
                            Nankivell also adds that money has been allocated to improve education in First Nations communities. Canada 150 is an opportunity to shine a light on the issue of reconciliation with First Nations, while also showcasing the
                            three other themes running throughout the campaign (diversity and inclusion, youth, and environment).</p>
                        <p><i>“I THINK IT’S AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION THAT WE CAN BRING INTO THE WORLD: THAT WE ARE NOT ONLY SHARING OUR ACHIEVEMENTS, BUT ALSO OUR CHALLENGES.”</i></p>
                        <p>Whether it’s policy, culture, or the legal system, Hong Kong and Canada influence each other in numerous ways. Hong Kong and Canada are part of a community of common law jurisdictions, in which decisions in Canadian courts can
                            be cited as precedent in a court case in Hong Kong, and vice versa. The Chief Justice of Canada was in Hong Kong in 2016 to take part in exchanges with their judicial counterparts. In the cultural sphere, there are Cantonese
                            opera schools in Canada, where new Cantonese opera is being composed and performed in Toronto and Vancouver. Celebrities, such as the actress and Canada 150 ambassador Bernice Liu, work between Hong Kong and Canada in both
                            English and Cantonese, taking part in the creation of media for diverse audiences.</p>
                        <p>The influence was felt at the event. The proud singing of the national anthem inspired the Chinese audience members to respond in kind for the People’s Republic national anthem, a rare raising of voices. Equally rare was an off
                            script moment for the CE CY Leung, who complemented the Consul General’s command of Cantonese, equating it to that of his parents after they had lived in Hong Kong for 50 years.</p>
                        <p>Nankivell plays hockey every Sunday night with the SCIHL, a recreational hockey league, and to his delight he says that his teammates are “as dedicated to hockey as they are dedicated to Hong Kong.” He is also pleased to announce
                            that he will be attending the Canada 150 events at Shore Steak Lounge and Terrace on 1 July, serving up pancakes to the people – a Canadian tradition that reminds us that the government serves the people – preferably with maple
                            syrup. In the Consul General’s case, that breakfast will include a generous helping of his enthusiasm for his nation.</p>
