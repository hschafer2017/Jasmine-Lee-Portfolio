                        <h5>September 2017</h5>
                        <p>It was a warm and sunny September day in Istanbul when I met a young Syrian man working at the hostel where I stayed for the first few days while I searched for a more permanent place to stay during the four months I would spend
                            in Turkey. To respect his wishes and personal privacy, I will address my friend by his first initial, S. During my short stay at the hostel, he and I became friends and we would regularly see each other while I was in Istanbul.
                            Over the next few months that I spent in the city, I came to a better understanding of the social and political ramifications of the flood of Syrian refugees that have entered Turkey over the last few years. Before I returned
                            to Canada, I asked S if I could interview him regarding his experience coming to Turkey six years ago as a refugee, to which he kindly agreed. As someone who had only understood the refugee crisis in terms of numbers and data,
                            I hoped that I would be able to gain some insight into the personal stories of someone whose life was transformed by the Syrian Civil War.</p>
                        <h6>“I’m wanted and we cannot stay anymore.”</h6>
                        <p>The first question I asked S was why he had to leave home, the Syrian city of Latakia, when he was 15 years old. “It was because of my father,” he began. As a doctor, his father used to treat people who were injured during Syria’s
                            first revolution in 2011. Through his work, he became vocal against the regime, and it was his activism which made him wanted in his country. S then told me that his father had been to jail before for this very reason, and
                            upon learning that the government sought to imprison him once again, he decided they had to leave. S recounted the last day he spent at home: “I was sitting and watching TV and my father called us… he said, ‘Each of you can
                            just bring one bag; we are leaving today. I’m wanted and we cannot stay anymore.’” The next morning, S, his siblings, and his parents left Syria, each person travelling with one small bag to what would be their new life in
                            Antakya, a city located near the Syrian border in the south of Turkey.</p>
                        <p>Adjusting to life in Turkey, in S’s experience, was not too difficult. “It takes some time, especially [since] we didn’t know the language. But fortunately, we moved to a city where half of the population is Arabic. It was a little
                            difficult first, but let’s be honest — after you learn the language it’s not that difficult to adjust to life here — at least that was my experience.” In his six years in Turkey, he has acquired Turkish to advanced fluency,
                            and his English is convincing enough that I thought he had spent much longer than he really has to learn the language. His parents, on the other hand, refrained from learning Turkish, for reasons which S said may be partially
                            due to their age, but more so because of a certain optimism that they will return home. “My father’s plan is to get back home,” S confided, “so he hasn’t bothered to learn Turkish… I think he wakes up every day thinking he
                            will go back.” I inquired about his thoughts on this idea, to which he responded, “Right now it’s not realistic at all.” Regardless of the war’s outcome in Syria, S doubts that his family would ever be able to go back.</p>
                        <h6>“Everyone is praying for Syria to get better, but nothing happened.”</h6>
                        <p>“I used to be a very religious man,” S admitted. Knowing S as someone who has a septum piercing, loves heavy metal, and has a propensity for smoking and drinking, this came to me as a surprise. “I used to pray five times every
                            day, I used to fast, and I used to read the Quran at least three times per week.” His transformation away from religion came at the age of 17 or 18, which led him to become the atheist he is today. Coming from a very religious
                            family, he noted that once during a phone call, his father asked him if he still prays, and, to his father’s dismay, S replied that he did not. I recalled one night on a full moon in September when S told me that the war changed
                            the way he perceived religion, and asked him to elaborate on what he meant:</p>
                        <p><i>“In the Quran and in holy books, they say just pray to god and everything will be okay. And I started thinking, you know, everyone is praying for Syria to get better, but nothing happened, so there’s something wrong. After ISIS showed up I started looking for the rules of ISIS and the Islamic military groups, and I really found them in the Quran.”</i></p>
                        <p>He acknowledged that many people do disagree with him, instead saying that the Quran is only supportive of nonviolence and that ISIS perverts the text to their own benefit. Ultimately S disagrees, adamant that there are parts of
                            the holy book that do not align with peaceful values.</p>
                        <h6>"Oh, he's Syrian."</h6>
                        <p>During my time in Istanbul, I witnessed many anti-Arab comments that were made in casual conversations where the word ‘Arab’ would be mentioned with negative connotations. It is often brought up when discussing how certain neighbourhoods
                            in the city have become much worse off due to the influx of Arabs in the population within the last few years. For those who see Istanbul as having fallen from a once-golden age, it seemed to me that it is easiest for the Turkish
                            population to pin blame on the non-native newcomers. I asked S how this discrimination has affected him; while he also harbours resentment towards his people for the violence that they have inflicted upon each other in recent
                            history, he admitted that his negative feelings come from a different place of understanding than that of the Turkish. “Their perspective is racist,” he stated bluntly, but then back-pedalled. “There’s no racism, [in Turkey]
                            it’s nationalism… I’ve met a lot of people who treat me very well but at the same time I knew that they would say, ‘Oh, he’s Syrian,’… in a negative way.” Last year, S began university at a private school in Istanbul, and it
                            has been hard for him to make friends: “I feel like at [university] no one likes me… partly because I am Syrian, but I don’t know why.” While he is not afraid to tell people that he is Syrian, he avoids the other Syrian students
                            at the school, perhaps for fear of being associated with them. Despite these experiences, “It’s not the whole country [that doesn’t like Arabs],” he insisted. “I feel like people who are modern, open, free, and not too religious
                            are more open to Syrians or other cultures, nations, and nationalities.” While he does not want to be ungrateful to the country he lives in, he does think that the government has used their status as the country to accept the
                            largest number of Syrian refugees as a means of bolstering their international public appearance.</p>
                        <p>I wondered what S thought about the word ‘refugee’, and what it means to him in comparison to how the world perceives it. S answered, “[‘Refugee’ means] someone who had to move from his or her mother country to another country
                            for a lot of reasons. I don’t know how people define the word ‘refugee’, but for most people in the world, the word ‘refugee’ is not good, even for the refugees. A lot of refugees don’t like to call themselves refugees because
                            they think it’s something bad.” I asked him if he identifies as one of those people, and he shook his head saying, “No, I’m just a refugee. It doesn’t mean I’m a bad person or it doesn’t mean I’m a cheater to my country. It
                            just means that I escaped from my country because I had to.”</p>
                        <h6>"I miss home; who doesn't miss home?"</h6>
                        <p>“Do you feel like you’re at home here?” I had hardly finished my question before he cut in with a resounding, “No,” and a timid chuckle. “I don’t feel like I’m at home because I’m not at home, that’s it. This is not a place where
                            I was born, where I grew up. This is not my language, this is not my country, not my food, not my flag, not my people.” When I asked him if he is proud of his nationality, he said that he is not. But regardless of the complex
                            feelings he harbours against his people, he seemed certainly sure of one thing: “I miss home; who doesn’t miss home?” I then asked what he missed most about home, to which he replied, “I miss my childhood, I miss our summer
                            house. I miss my cousins sometimes.” He doesn’t talk to his cousins much these days, who are still in Syria, but said he thinks he would feel more at home if they were here. I remember looking at his eyes which seemed to be
                            red, and hoped that it wasn’t because he was holding back tears. S wished he brought his tennis racket with him, as he used to play the sport and loved to watch it on television. I asked, “Who was your favourite —” and before
                            I even finished, he said, without hesitation, “Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray.” He also told me about his family’s photo albums: “I wish I had my photos of when I was a kid… we used to have a very good camera, so my parents used
                            to take a lot of photos of us when we were playing… So each one of us has an album… I wish I had it right now.”</p>
                        <p>Although he is currently studying engineering, one of S’s aspirations is to become a journalist because, as he jokingly put in his own words, “The Middle East will always be on fire.” He is still in Turkey and has no plans of going
                            anywhere else in the next few years. Despite his pessimistic outlook on the political situation in Syria, I genuinely wish that before long, he will be able to go back — where he will hopefully rediscover what it is like to
                            feel at home.</p>

          Erdoğan Calls Monument of Turkish-Armenian Relations a “Monstrosity”
        </a>

                        <h5>January 2018</h5>
                        <p>Turkish sculptor Mehmet Aksoy is no stranger to provoking conflict over his works of art. He has had politicians in his country disapprove of his work, such as the mayor of Ankara who took down Aksoy’s sculpture “At the Country
                            of Fairies”, and said, “If this is art, I’d spit on it”. Most controversial was perhaps his large sculpture called <i>Monument to Humanity</i>, which symbolized friendship between Turkey and Armenia. The monument with a height
                            of 35 metres was located on a hill overlooking Kars, close to the Armenian border. It was a giant piece commissioned in 2006 by the Kars municipality at a time when the AKP government was attempting to make amends through diplomatic
                            relations with Armenia’s government. The sculpture itself depicts two human figures facing each other, with the one that is meant to represent Turkey holding its hand out to the other figure which represented Armenia.</p>
                        <p>The trouble with this particular work is multifaceted because of the reaction it received from President Erdoğan as well as because of the subject matter of the work. When visiting Kars in 2011, Erdoğan went to see the statues
                            and called them a “monstrosity”, which caused a public outcry, and the municipality then demolished the statues. Aksoy took the case to court, suing Erdoğan for $3,800 for insulting <i>Monument to Humanity</i>, with the judge
                            ruling in Aksoy’s favour. While this is a positive outcome for the artist, it is too late for the remains of the structure that lay in waste where the sculpture once stood.</p>
                        <p>The other side of this controversial piece concerns the Armenian genocide of 1915, which to this day is a taboo subject in Turkish politics and daily life. Although the monument isn’t explicitly about the issue, and rather just
                            seeks to promote peaceful relations between the countries, all socio-political issues between Turkey and Armenia are haunted by the genocide. In this historical atrocity, approximately 1.5 million Armenians in the Ottoman Empire
                            were killed and many more forcibly removed from the country. The Turkish government still does not acknowledge the significance of this event to this day, and it is currently illegal to discuss the genocide in Turkey. Denial
                            of it ever happening is not uncommon amongst civilians, and there is typically a sense of unease when the topic is ever brought up to discussion.</p>
                        <p>Aksoy’s <i>Monument to Humanity</i> brings awareness of a contentious history between two countries in which one expelled the other’s people in a violent and undignified manner. Although this occurred more than five years ago,
                            the demolition of this sculpture perhaps represents a government and society that is still, in 2017, not ready to appreciate such art, especially one that deals with the country’s dark past.</p>

          North Koreans As Clickbait: Changing the Narrative to People Over Politics

                        <h5>November 2015</h5>
                        <p>There is a problem with how North Korea is portrayed in our society. The only news that makes the mainstream news channels are headlines that will increase ratings and views, which in the case of North Korea consists of the Kim
                            family dynamic and the constant threat of a nuclear attack. At the same time, popular culture has made North Korea’s authoritarian government both a notorious and comedic specimen, with the spotlight focused on the current
                            leader Kim Jong-Un. The Internet is the perfect example; it is littered with memes, videos, and even blogs making fun of North Korea’s oppressive government and ruling family. One popular Tumblr blog called “Kim Jong-Un Looking
                            At Things” is exactly what it claims to be: a page full of photos of the controversial leader gazing at and interacting with something as mundane as soap, to professional basketball player Dennis Rodman. This is only one of
                            many examples that exist on the Internet, casually tossed around so often without thinking of the social consequences that arise from seemingly harmless jokes.</p>
                        <p>On a much larger scale, one needs to look no further than <i>The Interview</i>, a controversial comedy released over the summer that centres around two journalists played by Seth Rogen and James Franco. The two men are recruited
                            by the CIA to set up an interview with Kim Jong-Un and to assassinate him. Although the movie was made to capitalize off of an audience that finds great humour in making fun of North Korea, the intention to make a comedy of
                            this country does not suit well for everyone. In a recent article published by Vice News, when a North Korean refugee named Daniel was shown the trailer to the movie, he turned it off ninety seconds in and said, “Not funny.”
                            North Koreans do not see the leader as a joke, but as a society we have been blissfully failing to consider an entire population in need of international help that is not being provided. Once again, the focus remains on the
                            outlandish Kims rather than the average citizens living in North Korea.</p>
                        <p>The mainstream media does occasionally pay attention to the North Korean populace, but not in a way that is beneficial to the social stigma already surrounding the country. Citizens are mistakenly portrayed as crazed and brainwashed
                            followers with an undying loyalty to the ruling government, when in reality, the people do not blindly obey every command from the authorities. This is portrayed in one of the few factual documentaries, <i>Frontline: Secret State of North Korea</i>,
                            which is a footage smuggled out of North Korea. There is a scene in the film where an officer tries to stop a woman from picking up passengers in the back of her truck. Instead of listening, she retaliates and tells him off
                            in a harsh tone, asking him what kind of officer he was if he didn’t wear any stars on his uniform. A similar incident occurs when a woman wearing pants is told by officers that what she is wearing is inappropriate. This woman
                            angrily asks them why they are only targeting her when there are other women around them who are wearing pants. Despite the officers’ attempts to non-violently subdue her in a firm verbal manner, she continued to persist and
                            question their authority. People are actually becoming more willing to confront authorities when they believe a law they are convicted of infringing is irrational, given that the issue is not political. This is especially the
                            case for elites who have enough agency to voice their discontent with the regime.</p>
                        <p>From here one must call to attention <i>why</i> this representation (or misrepresentation, rather) of North Korea has such a negative impact on the livelihoods of North Koreans and the foreign assistance that they receive. There
                            is simply a lack of insight or focus on the situation’s urgency and legitimacy at the international level. For example, according to the organization Liberty In North Korea, 70% of surveyed Americans had not heard of the famine
                            in North Korea, while 50% were unaware of North Korea’s prison camps, where conditions are comparable to Holocaust concentration camps and the gulags of the USSR. People face public execution for watching South Korean films
                            and lending the DVDs to friends, something that is considered a very serious crime in North Korea. Even with these human rights atrocities, the social reputation that is upheld by the media outside of North Korea prevents us
                            from learning about the disturbing nature of the North Korean lives.</p>
                        <p>There needs to be a shift in how North Korea is depicted in our society, from its politics to its people; and Liberty In North Korea is an organization dedicated to that. Their mission includes helping refugees settle into their
                            new lives as well as changing the narrative from the politics onto the people. Its website and blog aim to inform those who are both familiar and unfamiliar with the North Korean conflict, making it an excellent source for
                            anyone who is interested in this issue. By acknowledging that altering the mass perspective is key to initiating a rise in the urgency at which we treat this problem, they include their agenda which detail the methodology they
                            plan to utilize in achieving their goals.</p>
                        <p>Even though our society has the resources available to learn about North Korea without the bias of popular culture, it is more comfortable to see North Korea in the way most of us do now. This is not just a matter of tradition,
                            but also because it is easier than admitting that the outside world is responsible to act as a catalyst for change in North Korea. In other words, perpetuating these stereotypes of North Korea as both a laughable regime and
                            a hopeless dystopian part of our world dehumanizes the situation, making it difficult to empathize with those suffering under the Kim regime. Although the action needed to bring about significant change for the North Korean
                            people is daunting (it costs $3,000 to rescue one refugee and settle them into a comfortable new life), the only way to start is to garner international attention toward the stories about North Korea refugees, which continuously
                            prove to be remarkable and horrifying. In the <a href="#">Vice News article</a> mentioned previously, one nineteen year old describes his escape from North Korea, including the thousands of miles he had to travel alone and
                            the difficult process he had to endure before finally securing a job as a sushi chef in the San Francisco Bay Area. There is also Seongmin Lee, a refugee who settled in Toronto, who has widely shared the details of his life
                            living in North Korea, such as executions, smuggling defectors, and lawful punishment for watching South Korean shows and movies which are illegal in the country. Many other refugees have their own stories to share, each with
                            a lesson to be learned about the dynamics of the North Korean regime. It is these voices that need to be heard, voices that paint a genuine portrait of life in North Korea. That way a proper dialogue can begin, replacing the
                            one that is based on a North Korea built from the stereotypes of poorly researched American film producers.</p>
                        <p>Asides from international assistance, <i>Frontline: Secret State of North Korea</i> suggests that interior networks are key in order to begin the process of change from within the country. In the Middle East, access to social media
                            sites like Twitter strengthened movements. North Korea does not yet have such a tool, but with the wide introduction of cell phones, foreign movies and TV shows and various products from the international market, the wall that
                            keeps North Korea hidden can become more permeable. Given the resistance and tensions regarding unhappiness with the regime, there is great potential that something significant could happen in the future. It is only a matter
                            of changing both key internal and external factors, which will come as a result of time.</p>
