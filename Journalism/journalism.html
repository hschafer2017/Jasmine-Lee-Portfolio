                        <h5>September 2017</h5>
                        <p>It was a warm and sunny September day in Istanbul when I met a young Syrian man working at the hostel where I stayed for the first few days while I searched for a more permanent place to stay during the four months I would spend
                            in Turkey. To respect his wishes and personal privacy, I will address my friend by his first initial, S. During my short stay at the hostel, he and I became friends and we would regularly see each other while I was in Istanbul.
                            Over the next few months that I spent in the city, I came to a better understanding of the social and political ramifications of the flood of Syrian refugees that have entered Turkey over the last few years. Before I returned
                            to Canada, I asked S if I could interview him regarding his experience coming to Turkey six years ago as a refugee, to which he kindly agreed. As someone who had only understood the refugee crisis in terms of numbers and data,
                            I hoped that I would be able to gain some insight into the personal stories of someone whose life was transformed by the Syrian Civil War.</p>
                        <h6>“I’m wanted and we cannot stay anymore.”</h6>
                        <p>The first question I asked S was why he had to leave home, the Syrian city of Latakia, when he was 15 years old. “It was because of my father,” he began. As a doctor, his father used to treat people who were injured during Syria’s
                            first revolution in 2011. Through his work, he became vocal against the regime, and it was his activism which made him wanted in his country. S then told me that his father had been to jail before for this very reason, and
                            upon learning that the government sought to imprison him once again, he decided they had to leave. S recounted the last day he spent at home: “I was sitting and watching TV and my father called us… he said, ‘Each of you can
                            just bring one bag; we are leaving today. I’m wanted and we cannot stay anymore.’” The next morning, S, his siblings, and his parents left Syria, each person travelling with one small bag to what would be their new life in
                            Antakya, a city located near the Syrian border in the south of Turkey.</p>
                        <p>Adjusting to life in Turkey, in S’s experience, was not too difficult. “It takes some time, especially [since] we didn’t know the language. But fortunately, we moved to a city where half of the population is Arabic. It was a little
                            difficult first, but let’s be honest — after you learn the language it’s not that difficult to adjust to life here — at least that was my experience.” In his six years in Turkey, he has acquired Turkish to advanced fluency,
                            and his English is convincing enough that I thought he had spent much longer than he really has to learn the language. His parents, on the other hand, refrained from learning Turkish, for reasons which S said may be partially
                            due to their age, but more so because of a certain optimism that they will return home. “My father’s plan is to get back home,” S confided, “so he hasn’t bothered to learn Turkish… I think he wakes up every day thinking he
                            will go back.” I inquired about his thoughts on this idea, to which he responded, “Right now it’s not realistic at all.” Regardless of the war’s outcome in Syria, S doubts that his family would ever be able to go back.</p>
                        <h6>“Everyone is praying for Syria to get better, but nothing happened.”</h6>
                        <p>“I used to be a very religious man,” S admitted. Knowing S as someone who has a septum piercing, loves heavy metal, and has a propensity for smoking and drinking, this came to me as a surprise. “I used to pray five times every
                            day, I used to fast, and I used to read the Quran at least three times per week.” His transformation away from religion came at the age of 17 or 18, which led him to become the atheist he is today. Coming from a very religious
                            family, he noted that once during a phone call, his father asked him if he still prays, and, to his father’s dismay, S replied that he did not. I recalled one night on a full moon in September when S told me that the war changed
                            the way he perceived religion, and asked him to elaborate on what he meant:</p>
                        <p><i>“In the Quran and in holy books, they say just pray to god and everything will be okay. And I started thinking, you know, everyone is praying for Syria to get better, but nothing happened, so there’s something wrong. After ISIS showed up I started looking for the rules of ISIS and the Islamic military groups, and I really found them in the Quran.”</i></p>
                        <p>He acknowledged that many people do disagree with him, instead saying that the Quran is only supportive of nonviolence and that ISIS perverts the text to their own benefit. Ultimately S disagrees, adamant that there are parts of
                            the holy book that do not align with peaceful values.</p>
                        <h6>"Oh, he's Syrian."</h6>
                        <p>During my time in Istanbul, I witnessed many anti-Arab comments that were made in casual conversations where the word ‘Arab’ would be mentioned with negative connotations. It is often brought up when discussing how certain neighbourhoods
                            in the city have become much worse off due to the influx of Arabs in the population within the last few years. For those who see Istanbul as having fallen from a once-golden age, it seemed to me that it is easiest for the Turkish
                            population to pin blame on the non-native newcomers. I asked S how this discrimination has affected him; while he also harbours resentment towards his people for the violence that they have inflicted upon each other in recent
                            history, he admitted that his negative feelings come from a different place of understanding than that of the Turkish. “Their perspective is racist,” he stated bluntly, but then back-pedalled. “There’s no racism, [in Turkey]
                            it’s nationalism… I’ve met a lot of people who treat me very well but at the same time I knew that they would say, ‘Oh, he’s Syrian,’… in a negative way.” Last year, S began university at a private school in Istanbul, and it
                            has been hard for him to make friends: “I feel like at [university] no one likes me… partly because I am Syrian, but I don’t know why.” While he is not afraid to tell people that he is Syrian, he avoids the other Syrian students
                            at the school, perhaps for fear of being associated with them. Despite these experiences, “It’s not the whole country [that doesn’t like Arabs],” he insisted. “I feel like people who are modern, open, free, and not too religious
                            are more open to Syrians or other cultures, nations, and nationalities.” While he does not want to be ungrateful to the country he lives in, he does think that the government has used their status as the country to accept the
                            largest number of Syrian refugees as a means of bolstering their international public appearance.</p>
                        <p>I wondered what S thought about the word ‘refugee’, and what it means to him in comparison to how the world perceives it. S answered, “[‘Refugee’ means] someone who had to move from his or her mother country to another country
                            for a lot of reasons. I don’t know how people define the word ‘refugee’, but for most people in the world, the word ‘refugee’ is not good, even for the refugees. A lot of refugees don’t like to call themselves refugees because
                            they think it’s something bad.” I asked him if he identifies as one of those people, and he shook his head saying, “No, I’m just a refugee. It doesn’t mean I’m a bad person or it doesn’t mean I’m a cheater to my country. It
                            just means that I escaped from my country because I had to.”</p>
                        <h6>"I miss home; who doesn't miss home?"</h6>
                        <p>“Do you feel like you’re at home here?” I had hardly finished my question before he cut in with a resounding, “No,” and a timid chuckle. “I don’t feel like I’m at home because I’m not at home, that’s it. This is not a place where
                            I was born, where I grew up. This is not my language, this is not my country, not my food, not my flag, not my people.” When I asked him if he is proud of his nationality, he said that he is not. But regardless of the complex
                            feelings he harbours against his people, he seemed certainly sure of one thing: “I miss home; who doesn’t miss home?” I then asked what he missed most about home, to which he replied, “I miss my childhood, I miss our summer
                            house. I miss my cousins sometimes.” He doesn’t talk to his cousins much these days, who are still in Syria, but said he thinks he would feel more at home if they were here. I remember looking at his eyes which seemed to be
                            red, and hoped that it wasn’t because he was holding back tears. S wished he brought his tennis racket with him, as he used to play the sport and loved to watch it on television. I asked, “Who was your favourite —” and before
                            I even finished, he said, without hesitation, “Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray.” He also told me about his family’s photo albums: “I wish I had my photos of when I was a kid… we used to have a very good camera, so my parents used
                            to take a lot of photos of us when we were playing… So each one of us has an album… I wish I had it right now.”</p>
                        <p>Although he is currently studying engineering, one of S’s aspirations is to become a journalist because, as he jokingly put in his own words, “The Middle East will always be on fire.” He is still in Turkey and has no plans of going
                            anywhere else in the next few years. Despite his pessimistic outlook on the political situation in Syria, I genuinely wish that before long, he will be able to go back — where he will hopefully rediscover what it is like to
                            feel at home.</p>

          Erdoğan Calls Monument of Turkish-Armenian Relations a “Monstrosity”
        </a>

                        <h5>January 2018</h5>
                        <p>Turkish sculptor Mehmet Aksoy is no stranger to provoking conflict over his works of art. He has had politicians in his country disapprove of his work, such as the mayor of Ankara who took down Aksoy’s sculpture “At the Country
                            of Fairies”, and said, “If this is art, I’d spit on it”. Most controversial was perhaps his large sculpture called <i>Monument to Humanity</i>, which symbolized friendship between Turkey and Armenia. The monument with a height
                            of 35 metres was located on a hill overlooking Kars, close to the Armenian border. It was a giant piece commissioned in 2006 by the Kars municipality at a time when the AKP government was attempting to make amends through diplomatic
                            relations with Armenia’s government. The sculpture itself depicts two human figures facing each other, with the one that is meant to represent Turkey holding its hand out to the other figure which represented Armenia.</p>
                        <p>The trouble with this particular work is multifaceted because of the reaction it received from President Erdoğan as well as because of the subject matter of the work. When visiting Kars in 2011, Erdoğan went to see the statues
                            and called them a “monstrosity”, which caused a public outcry, and the municipality then demolished the statues. Aksoy took the case to court, suing Erdoğan for $3,800 for insulting <i>Monument to Humanity</i>, with the judge
                            ruling in Aksoy’s favour. While this is a positive outcome for the artist, it is too late for the remains of the structure that lay in waste where the sculpture once stood.</p>
                        <p>The other side of this controversial piece concerns the Armenian genocide of 1915, which to this day is a taboo subject in Turkish politics and daily life. Although the monument isn’t explicitly about the issue, and rather just
                            seeks to promote peaceful relations between the countries, all socio-political issues between Turkey and Armenia are haunted by the genocide. In this historical atrocity, approximately 1.5 million Armenians in the Ottoman Empire
                            were killed and many more forcibly removed from the country. The Turkish government still does not acknowledge the significance of this event to this day, and it is currently illegal to discuss the genocide in Turkey. Denial
                            of it ever happening is not uncommon amongst civilians, and there is typically a sense of unease when the topic is ever brought up to discussion.</p>
                        <p>Aksoy’s <i>Monument to Humanity</i> brings awareness of a contentious history between two countries in which one expelled the other’s people in a violent and undignified manner. Although this occurred more than five years ago,
                            the demolition of this sculpture perhaps represents a government and society that is still, in 2017, not ready to appreciate such art, especially one that deals with the country’s dark past.</p>

          North Koreans As Clickbait: Changing the Narrative to People Over Politics

                        <h5>November 2015</h5>
                        <p>There is a problem with how North Korea is portrayed in our society. The only news that makes the mainstream news channels are headlines that will increase ratings and views, which in the case of North Korea consists of the Kim
                            family dynamic and the constant threat of a nuclear attack. At the same time, popular culture has made North Korea’s authoritarian government both a notorious and comedic specimen, with the spotlight focused on the current
                            leader Kim Jong-Un. The Internet is the perfect example; it is littered with memes, videos, and even blogs making fun of North Korea’s oppressive government and ruling family. One popular Tumblr blog called “Kim Jong-Un Looking
                            At Things” is exactly what it claims to be: a page full of photos of the controversial leader gazing at and interacting with something as mundane as soap, to professional basketball player Dennis Rodman. This is only one of
                            many examples that exist on the Internet, casually tossed around so often without thinking of the social consequences that arise from seemingly harmless jokes.</p>
                        <p>On a much larger scale, one needs to look no further than <i>The Interview</i>, a controversial comedy released over the summer that centres around two journalists played by Seth Rogen and James Franco. The two men are recruited
                            by the CIA to set up an interview with Kim Jong-Un and to assassinate him. Although the movie was made to capitalize off of an audience that finds great humour in making fun of North Korea, the intention to make a comedy of
                            this country does not suit well for everyone. In a recent article published by Vice News, when a North Korean refugee named Daniel was shown the trailer to the movie, he turned it off ninety seconds in and said, “Not funny.”
                            North Koreans do not see the leader as a joke, but as a society we have been blissfully failing to consider an entire population in need of international help that is not being provided. Once again, the focus remains on the
                            outlandish Kims rather than the average citizens living in North Korea.</p>
                        <p>The mainstream media does occasionally pay attention to the North Korean populace, but not in a way that is beneficial to the social stigma already surrounding the country. Citizens are mistakenly portrayed as crazed and brainwashed
                            followers with an undying loyalty to the ruling government, when in reality, the people do not blindly obey every command from the authorities. This is portrayed in one of the few factual documentaries, <i>Frontline: Secret State of North Korea</i>,
                            which is a footage smuggled out of North Korea. There is a scene in the film where an officer tries to stop a woman from picking up passengers in the back of her truck. Instead of listening, she retaliates and tells him off
                            in a harsh tone, asking him what kind of officer he was if he didn’t wear any stars on his uniform. A similar incident occurs when a woman wearing pants is told by officers that what she is wearing is inappropriate. This woman
                            angrily asks them why they are only targeting her when there are other women around them who are wearing pants. Despite the officers’ attempts to non-violently subdue her in a firm verbal manner, she continued to persist and
                            question their authority. People are actually becoming more willing to confront authorities when they believe a law they are convicted of infringing is irrational, given that the issue is not political. This is especially the
                            case for elites who have enough agency to voice their discontent with the regime.</p>
                        <p>From here one must call to attention <i>why</i> this representation (or misrepresentation, rather) of North Korea has such a negative impact on the livelihoods of North Koreans and the foreign assistance that they receive. There
                            is simply a lack of insight or focus on the situation’s urgency and legitimacy at the international level. For example, according to the organization Liberty In North Korea, 70% of surveyed Americans had not heard of the famine
                            in North Korea, while 50% were unaware of North Korea’s prison camps, where conditions are comparable to Holocaust concentration camps and the gulags of the USSR. People face public execution for watching South Korean films
                            and lending the DVDs to friends, something that is considered a very serious crime in North Korea. Even with these human rights atrocities, the social reputation that is upheld by the media outside of North Korea prevents us
                            from learning about the disturbing nature of the North Korean lives.</p>
                        <p>There needs to be a shift in how North Korea is depicted in our society, from its politics to its people; and Liberty In North Korea is an organization dedicated to that. Their mission includes helping refugees settle into their
                            new lives as well as changing the narrative from the politics onto the people. Its website and blog aim to inform those who are both familiar and unfamiliar with the North Korean conflict, making it an excellent source for
                            anyone who is interested in this issue. By acknowledging that altering the mass perspective is key to initiating a rise in the urgency at which we treat this problem, they include their agenda which detail the methodology they
                            plan to utilize in achieving their goals.</p>
                        <p>Even though our society has the resources available to learn about North Korea without the bias of popular culture, it is more comfortable to see North Korea in the way most of us do now. This is not just a matter of tradition,
                            but also because it is easier than admitting that the outside world is responsible to act as a catalyst for change in North Korea. In other words, perpetuating these stereotypes of North Korea as both a laughable regime and
                            a hopeless dystopian part of our world dehumanizes the situation, making it difficult to empathize with those suffering under the Kim regime. Although the action needed to bring about significant change for the North Korean
                            people is daunting (it costs $3,000 to rescue one refugee and settle them into a comfortable new life), the only way to start is to garner international attention toward the stories about North Korea refugees, which continuously
                            prove to be remarkable and horrifying. In the <a href="#">Vice News article</a> mentioned previously, one nineteen year old describes his escape from North Korea, including the thousands of miles he had to travel alone and
                            the difficult process he had to endure before finally securing a job as a sushi chef in the San Francisco Bay Area. There is also Seongmin Lee, a refugee who settled in Toronto, who has widely shared the details of his life
                            living in North Korea, such as executions, smuggling defectors, and lawful punishment for watching South Korean shows and movies which are illegal in the country. Many other refugees have their own stories to share, each with
                            a lesson to be learned about the dynamics of the North Korean regime. It is these voices that need to be heard, voices that paint a genuine portrait of life in North Korea. That way a proper dialogue can begin, replacing the
                            one that is based on a North Korea built from the stereotypes of poorly researched American film producers.</p>
                        <p>Asides from international assistance, <i>Frontline: Secret State of North Korea</i> suggests that interior networks are key in order to begin the process of change from within the country. In the Middle East, access to social media
                            sites like Twitter strengthened movements. North Korea does not yet have such a tool, but with the wide introduction of cell phones, foreign movies and TV shows and various products from the international market, the wall that
                            keeps North Korea hidden can become more permeable. Given the resistance and tensions regarding unhappiness with the regime, there is great potential that something significant could happen in the future. It is only a matter
                            of changing both key internal and external factors, which will come as a result of time.</p>

          <h6>Though a drought is not near, Hong Kong’s lack of action regarding its wasteful use of water will leave it treading if a crisis strikes in the near future. </h6>
          <p>The most apparent problem regarding Hong Kong’s water supply is perhaps the overconsumption on the domestic level. To get an idea of just how much water Hongkongers use on a day-to-day basis, per capita the total water usage is at approximately 180 litres, which includes the seawater used for flushing at about 50 litres a day. Therefore a total of 130 litres of freshwater is used by each individual on a daily basis. Compared to neighbouring cities such as Shanghai and Shenzhen, some of which use up to 15 litres less, Hong Kong is clearly the anomaly. Water is already globally scarce; only 2% of the world’s water is actually potable freshwater while Hong Kong is one of the most water scarce regions on Earth, making climate change a factor that only exacerbates this already-pressing situation.</p>
          <p>While there are too many facets in the big picture to include all of them coherently, this article plans to tackle in further detail the larger issues surrounding water sustainability in Hong Kong. It summarises Hong Kong’s freshwater supply history, discusses water’s true value, and then examines the staggering amount of water that is lost annually. This report also elaborates on how Hong Kong can take advantage of water technologies along with providing specific examples, followed by a closer look at Singapore as a case study that Hong Kong can model itself after when pursuing a sustainable future.</p>
          <h6>The history of Hong Kong's freshwater supply</h6>
          <p>Water sustainability efforts are currently at a large disadvantage in part due to the lack of public knowledge surrounding the issue. According to Dr Frederick Lee, Associate Professor at the University of Hong Kong, the reason for the public lack of awareness of the city’s freshwater supply can be found within the history of Hong Kong. Since the early 1980s Hong Kong has worked under the DongShen Agreement, a water supply agreement with the Guangdong region. In the present day, this river provides Hong Kong with about 80% of its freshwater, and it is as Lee says, “a political arrangement that guarantees that even if there is a major drought in the region, Hong Kong is given first priority to get their water from the river basin.” The origin story of this plentiful supply that remains largely unknown to the average Hongkonger, and it is this disconnect between the citizens and the source of their water that creates what Lee refers to as “a sense of complacency.” He cites a major drought that occurred in 2011, where some major cities in the Guangdong province were forced to ration water, while Hongkongers remained “insulated from any impacts”, completely sheltered from the widespread water shortage in the region.</p>
          <h6>The true value of water</h6>
          <p>Hong Kong needs to change how it values its water because people don’t prioritise it as highly as other resources. The fact that Hong Kong is next to the water gives people the wrong impression that there is plenty of it for them to use. The general public is also ignorant of the true value of water because it is heavily subsidised by the government. In the fiscal year of 1995-1996 water tariffs were frozen, and thus while the cost of water has gone up over time, the fees have remained the same with citizens paying less than half of the total unit cost of production. The current system in place for freshwater leaves people completely unaware of how much water they are using per month, how much the water they use is really worth, and how unsustainable the usage habits are on the large scale.</p>
          <p>In the words of Joyce Lau, Communications Director at think tank Civic Exchange, “Your average person doesn’t know these basic facts. They don’t know the water’s imported, they don’t know the water’s heavily subsidised. You turn on the tap, it comes out endlessly, it’s extremely cheap, and that’s all people know.” As a restaurant owner, Grander Water’s Kevin Tam agrees that the people simply are not being charged the fair price for water. The solution to this problem seems simple: raise the tariffs on water, and people will waste less. But the reality is that such a legal proposition would cause an uproar amongst citizens and businesses alike; this reason alone is one of the largest roadblocks preventing Hong Kong from becoming a water sustainable city.</p>
          <p>An immediate concern of raised water tariffs is the negative effect it would have on the lower to middle class in Hong Kong. Lau assures that this will not be the case: “We’ve been very clear from the beginning that any tariff raise cannot hurt your average working class Hong Kong family.” Hong Kong already has systems in place that ensure the lower-class would not suffer unjustly were tariff reform to occur. Civic Exchange’s recent report on this subject, <i>The Illusion of Plenty: Hong Kong’s Water Security, Working Towards Regional Water Harmony</i>, states that the average household’s water bill is currently HK$48 a month; in 2015-2016 13% of Hongkongers were fully subsidised for their water usage. Each individual is also allotted a generous 12 cubic metres of freshwater (approximately 20 bathtubs) for free every four months. While ensuring that any future water sustainability efforts don’t negatively affect the lives of the low to middle class, there is little room for complaint considering how insignificant and highly subsidised the water bill is in comparison to other living expenses. Since households with higher water usage tend to be of higher income, the idea is that the well-off should pay – at a minimum – the amount it costs the government to purchase water from China. “Water is a precious resource,” says Grander Water’s Kevin Tam, “You can’t just put a price tag on it that is so little that people don’t really care. For Hong Kong it might be a valid point to increase the cost. Until your average citizen in Hong Kong can say, ‘We’re using all sorts of different technologies to help save water’, increasing the price of water is the only way.’”</p>
          <h6>One third of Hong Kong's freshwater down the drain</h6>
          <p>Both the problems and solutions underlying Hong Kong’s water problem are not difficult to identify. The problem is that there are hefty obstacles that prevent water sustainability in Hong Kong from becoming a reality. Lee states that in order for the Legislative Council to even seriously consider such reform, Hong Kong needs to get a handle of the immense amount of water loss that occurs annually from leakage in government mains and private pipes, as well as theft. Together, <i>The Illusion of Plenty</i> found that up to one-third of this supply is lost, totalling to approximately HK$1.35 billion in revenue. Although the government celebrates the successes of the Total Water Management (TWM) Strategy, which was an initiative begun in 2003 that reduced the amount of wastage from government pipes in the past 10 years, this is not where the efforts should stop.</p>
          <p>Sam Inglis, Environmental Research Analyst at ADM Capital Foundation, says that while the leakage reductions of public pipes from 25% to 15% (a reduction of 10% over 15 years) are remarkable, this is only “the first phase.” “More must be done,” he posits, “with private leakage certainly being made a priority.” According to Inglis, the WSD have no plans to deal with private leakage in the near future. While commendable, the work of the TWM have proven to be inadequate for conservation and planning for Hong Kong’s long-term sustainability.</p>
          <h6>Embracing water sustainable technology</h6>
          <p>Another path of consideration to approach this dilemma is through water technologies. While strategies such as desalination are unsustainable due to the costliness of the process, there are numerous other options that are not hard to adopt. There has been already a variety of water-saving systems that can be installed in upcoming building projects, as well as technologies that can be incorporated to make older buildings more sustainable. Smaller examples include faucets and shower heads, which have been long available on the market, that disperse water in a way that gets the job done with less. Tam describes what he calls “a very simple technology”, where the outlet from which the water flows consists of layers that chop the water forming bubbles, reducing water usage by 30% whenever someone turns on the tap. This technology uses netting that distributes the water with higher pressure and lower speed, scattering the bubbled water in different directions. It successfully saves on water use without noticeably altering the experience when taking a shower or running the sink faucet. Other technology include toilets equipped with a dual flush mechanism which can save on the amount of water that is flushed on a daily basis. The most effective way to take advantage of these technologies would be to have them installed in new buildings, but according to Lee, these water-efficient appliances are not being made a part of these buildings’ infrastructure. That, he claims, is a strategy most likely to succeed if the government creates regulations that would administer their installation.</p>
          <p>What buildings can also do to decrease the amount of water they let go to waste is by making adjustments to their water tank systems. According to Tam, thousands of buildings in Hong Kong have water tanks for commercial and domestic use. When these water tanks are due for frequent cleaning, especially since Hong Kong’s geography makes these water tanks more privy to sedimentation buildup, this creates a lot of waste, as cleaning requires that the entire tank is dumped out then refilled afterwards.</p>
          <p>Grander Water is trying to ameliorate this wastage by encouraging buildings to reduce their tank cleanings to only once a year through the utilisation of Grander technology. “We can implement Grander technology into any tank, and basically after you change the water once it’s going to stay clean because it actually gets all the sediment off of the tank itself.” He also claims that within four to six weeks’ time, there should be a visible improvement in the water quality that is distributed from the tank. They already have two successful Grander system projects, one located at Tipco Tower in Thailand and the other at Lido Hotel in Guangzhou. The simple installation completed at Lido Hotel in 2012 has completely solved many of the hotel’s problems such as sedimentation, rust, and bacteria buildup, improving the overall quality of water in the building and substantially decreasing the amount of freshwater that would have been wasted from regular tank cleanings. Looking to the future, Tam hopes to eventually develop the sort of technology that would be able to make water a naturally renewable resource.</p>
          <h6>Singapore: setting and example for Hong Kong</h6>
          <p>Singapore is a good city to compare to Hong Kong as they share similar cityscapes and its people lead similar lifestyles as well. Despite their shared traits, Singapore has taken strides to reduce its per capita domestic water consumption, having decreased it from 165 litres per day in 2003 to the current 148. They are also aiming to further reduce it by another 8 litres to 140 per capita by 2030. While they set a shining example of water sustainability, the major difference that may render Singapore a difficult one to follow is that the government and its populace operate very differently from those of Hong Kong. Inglis states, “One of the things that Singapore does and has done for a really long time is they have made it a national priority to emphasise the importance and value of water.” Such a strategy based on encouraging action for the sake of nationalistic pride would be futile in Hong Kong, as its citizens do not share the same attitudes that are driving the water sustainability efforts in Singapore. “For Singapore,” he continues, “it’s an existential threat potentially. They have a deal with Malaysia, and because they have a somewhat contentious relationship at times, they don’t want to be held over a barrel effectively if a water crisis does come about.” Hong Kong does not share this situation and therefore can only take a limited amount of inspiration from Singapore.</p>
          <p>The way in which Hong Kong should follow in Singapore’s footsteps, according to Lee, is through the maximisation of local freshwater resources. Singapore has a future plan to reduce its imports from the current 40% to 0% by 2060. As of 2015, only 16.6% of Hong Kong’s freshwater comes from its public and privately owned local sources. In order to reach a point of ideal sustainability, Lee posits that the government “needs to cap and reduce” the amount of water it imports from China until the city is compelled to increase its reliance on local resources. Further research needs to be conducted in order to calculate an accurate depiction of how much Hong Kong’s local resources can realistically be maximised, and how much the importation of Dongjiang water can be minimised.</p>
          <h6>Conclusion: Bridging the gap between ideas and reality</h6>
          <p>Given all the factors at play, it is evident that there are missing pieces that need to be placed in order to administer the aforementioned solutions to better address Hong Kong’s water sustainability problem. While the public needs to pressure the government to prioritise this issue in order to ensure an appropriate response, this will not happen until the government invests in massive campaigning to raise public awareness. This would then welcome opportunities to legislate and enforce water-saving regulations. But before even considering tariff raises and other legislative reform, existing issues such as water wastage and leakage need to be addressed. While making Hong Kong more water sustainable does not necessarily require technology we don’t already have, Hong Kong needs to make better use of creative solutions found in water technologies that are not new as far as sustainable technology goes. Effective utilisation of these simple technologies would noticeably improve water usage without inconveniencing the lives of domestic consumers. In addendum, water sustainability in Hong Kong is still a young endeavour, and there are still much information to uncover in order to formulate a holistic solution. Bringing all these facets together, Hong Kong will be able to pave the way to a future that ensures a harmonious relationship between its water, the government, and its people.</p>
