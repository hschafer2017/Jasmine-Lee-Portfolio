                        <p>I didn’t quite know how to feel when I unintentionally found myself at one end of a polyamorous relationship. I was startled, to say the least, although I did not quite understand why. Don’t get me wrong, I have, for a long time,
                            firmly believed that loving, consensual relationships of any shape or form should be accepted and welcomed in society. But at the same time, it was an unexpected surprise to be told by someone I had just started seeing that
                            he had a girlfriend. Amidst my confusion, I felt the need to tell a few friends about how I was now involved in a polyamorous relationship. For the most part, the responses were neutral, if not supportive. But one of my friend’s
                            responses in particular stood out from the rest.</p>
                        <p>“That’s messed up,” my friend said abruptly, after sharing my experience with him.</p>
                        <p>“Not when there is consent on all ends of the relationship,” I argued.</p>
                        <p>“Nah, it’s still messed up.”</p>
                        <p>My friend’s strong reaction to polyamory – or more crucially, his reaction to a so-called deviant relationship form – spoke to a broader issue of how some forms of love and relationship structures are valued more and seen as more
                            legitimate in society at-large. It left me wondering where does this stigma come from, and why are so many people in our society averse to the idea of polyamory?</p>
                        <p>Monogamy dominates the representation of relationships in media. People who partake in more than one committed relationship at once are largely nonexistent in mainstream media. This has not only resulted in the absence of the term
                            “polyamory” amongst common knowledge, but it has also worked to spread misinformation among those who have heard of it, of what it truly means in practice.</p>
                        <p>In order to clear up these misconceptions, and to learn more about polyamory, I interviewed two people who identify as polyamorous: Jocelyn Beaudet, a student at Concordia University, and Jane*, a student in U1 at McGill, studying
                            linguistics and Sexual Diversity Studies. Each person I spoke with helped me clear up misconceptions of polyamory that run rampant in our society. They shared their experiences of polyamorous relationships, and the difficulties
                            they’ve encountered in a society where monogamy is understood as the only natural way that intimate relationships should form.</p>
                        <h6>Why polyamory?</h6>
                        <p>Much of the misunderstanding surrounding polyamory seems to stem from not knowing the actual definition. According to the best-selling novel The Ethical Slut, by Dossie Easton and Janet W. Hardy, polyamory is “being openly loving,
                            intimate, and sexual with many people.” Jocelyn’s working definition of polyamory also resonated with me, where he described it as “the foundation of ethical non-monogamy where you have defined relationships with more than
                            one person at the same time. By relationship I mean full-time, accessible, functional relationships that are both emotional and physical.”</p>
                        <p>People engage in polyamorous relationships for different reasons. In Jocelyn’s case, monogamy just doesn’t feel right. “It’s not necessarily because of neediness, or as the comments go to say, you’re just not happy with this person.
                            It’s just this void of emotions that one person cannot realistically fulfill.”</p>
                        <p>By this “void”, he is referring to the emptiness felt when there are hobbies he wants to share with his partner, that are not of interest to them. “The gap that exists […] is so wide [that] even if you love someone in their entirety
                            and they love you back, there’s still that feeling [that occurs] when you’re single and you wish you were with someone.”</p>
                        <p>When I asked Jane why she chose to be polyamorous, she answered simply, “Freedom.”</p>
                        <p>“It’s not about [dating multiple people], it’s about being allowed to. I don’t want anyone to tell me what to do with my body, and [vice versa]. I don’t want to tell anyone who to love or who to be with. I think they’re allowed
                            to be whatever they want.”</p>
                        <p>The idea of polyamory, and forming intimate relationships with multiple people, goes directly against the normalized monogamous narrative we’re so often bombarded with in mainstream media and day-to-day interactions. Women are
                            particularly subject to the policing of their behaviour, bodies, and relationships. If a woman engages in multiple relationships – as a polyamorous woman would – she’s subject to being pitted as a ‘easy’ or a ‘slut.’ The motive
                            behind this type of policing is incredibly insidious and deeply embedded in our society. The omnipresent promotion of monogamy as the be-all-end-all of relationships is in directly relation to promoting the livelihood of the
                            patriarchal capitalist state. As such, polyamorous people often face accusations that aim to villainize their relationship practice in opposition to ‘healthy’ and ‘normal’ monogamous relationships. These accusations of polyamorous
                            people being cheaters, and unfaithful to their primary partners, of being ‘greedy’ in terms of sex and desire for intimacy, or to being in multiple relationships purely for intercourse, need to be put out of their misery.</p>
                        <h6>Polyamory is not cheating</h6>
                        <p>Upon asking Jane what one of the most common misunderstandings of polyamory is, she said that many people think that it is cheating. In Jane’s words, polyamory is “making sure that every partner in the relationship is aware of
                            what’s happening.” Therefore, cheating has nothing to do with it.</p>
                        <p>Unfortunately, many people who are introduced to polyamory have trouble wrapping their minds around this concept. Whenever Jane shares her relationship issues with friends, “the one thing that comes back [even] if it has nothing
                            to do with the issue [is that I] ‘slept with other people’ […] and that’s what made things go bad in the relationship.”</p>
                        <p>When discussing this topic with Rachel Costin, a university student in Toronto, she excellently explained it by saying that “cheating is going outside the boundaries set by you and your partners, [and] because seeing other people
                            is outside the boundaries of a standard relationship, people automatically assume that it is cheating.” Those who think polyamory is cheating don’t understand that with a different type of relationship comes different rules
                            and standards, and that the rules of monogamy do not apply to all relationships.</p>
                        <h6>Polyamory is not about greed</h6>
                        <p>Another common misconception about polyamory is that it is a greedy and selfish practice, as it is supposedly “taking more people out of the dating pool” as Jocelyn told me.</p>
                        <p>Jocelyn finds this idea to be ironic. “Monogamy is claiming someone as my girlfriend, my boyfriend, my partner.” Monogamy’s usage of possessive adjectives, along with utter refusal to create loving relationships with more than
                            one person, has if anything, a closer resemblance to greed than polyamory.</p>
                        <p>Jane also made a couple of interesting comparisons herself. “If I work in one cafe, and I work in another one, that doesn’t mean I don’t do my job well in the other one, and it doesn’t mean that I don’t like working in the second
                            one or the first one. It just means that I work at two cafes. If I have two best friends, it doesn’t mean that I love one more than the other, it just means that I love them differently.”</p>
                        <p>People who take up more than one job are never accused of wanting more money, nor are people who have more than one really close friend accused of being greedy for more love and friendships. If this is so, why are polyamorous people
                            still accused of being selfish for desiring love from more than one relationship?</p>
                        <h6>Advice for polycurious monogamists</h6>
                        <p>As someone who unexpectedly found herself in a polyamorous relationship, I constantly thought about whether or not I would be able to continue in a long-term polyamorous relationship. Growing up with the expectation that I would
                            only be in monogamous relationships, I was unprepared for something so strange and new. I didn’t know if I could ever feel comfortable knowing that I was not the only significant person in a partner’s life. I also questioned
                            whether it was worth facing the disapproval of my friends were they to ever find out the kind of relationship I was in.</p>
                        <p>Upon asking Jocelyn how people like me could give polyamory a shot, he recommended being honest to the people you intend to be with. Both Jocelyn and Jane agreed that as bad as it sounds, it is difficult to discuss openly about
                            polyamory with friends, and in some cases, it might be better to withhold some information until you’re more comfortable with it yourself. Jocelyn said “[telling friends] what it’s about, why you’re doing it, and why you feel
                            that way” can greatly help when sharing the details of your love life.</p>
                        <p>One other strategy that he said worked particularly well was taking both his partners and his friends for a night out. It was effective because his friends got the chance to see that there was no jealousy amongst Jocelyn and his
                            significant others, and that perhaps polyamory is not so bad after all.</p>
                            <h6>Polyamory at McGill</h6>
                        <p>Talking to Jane, I asked her what it was like to be a polyamorous a student at McGill. Although there are many university initiatives that strive for safer space, Jane is still both directly and indirectly subject to judgement by both teachers and students. How accepted she feels in the McGill community depends on the person, program, or class being dealt with.</p>
                        <p>Some people are “totally understanding of [polyamory, while] there are others who just did not understand the concept. They only saw it as cheating.”</p>
                        <p>In regards to her experiences in class, she has sometimes felt marginalized as a polyamorous woman. “In Sexual Diversity Studies, [polyamory] is acceptable, but when you go outside of these things, the professors and TAs don’t acknowledge this kind of relationship.”</p>
                        <p>Jane told me an example of this tension, where her history professor told a joke about a roommate who maybe had a new sexual partner. In the end of the story, Jane felt it reasserted the norm that everyone should only have one partner. The prof had meant no harm, but the joke still left Jane feeling like the butt end of a bad laugh, and uncomfortable with her sexual identity.</p>
                        <p>If this situation were to happen in a group of friends at McGill or in a Sexual Diversity Studies class, she would not have been afraid to call someone out on their joke. But in a history class, she did not feel that calling it out would be either relevant or well received. Jane told me she wouldn’t have the support of other classmates that she would have in a class related to gender or sexual diversity.</p>
                        <p>To make McGill a safer space for polyamorous people and people who practice other forms of non-normative relationships in more than just a select number of classes, Jane agrees that the students and staff should be educated on the topic.</p>
                        <p>She thinks that most people “would just dismiss it, but it’s very important to make people aware of polyamory’s existence.” By teaching others about polyamory, more people would identify with this sexuality, since the term is rather unknown among the public. Besides the occasional judgement she has experienced at McGill, overall Jane finds that it is definitely better here than some other places in Quebec, where she has met people who are very strongly opposed to polyamory. Even so, McGill still has a way to go before becoming the welcoming space to alternative forms of relationships.</p>
                        <p>Polyamory is not about leading a promiscuous lifestyle, nor is it some innate greed for more love and attention. As in most monogamous relationships, polyamory is not just about receiving love. As Jocelyn put it, “It’s more about giving. We have so much love to give that only one person could not possibly be the target of all of it.” This idea of purity in our romantic and sexual lives that has been ingrained into our culture makes it harder for non-monogamous relationships to openly thrive.</p>

                        <h6><i>Gulabi Gang</i> film sheds light on gender oppression and resistance</h6>
                        <p>Cinema Politica’s first screening of the year featured the 2012 documentary <i>Gulabi Gang</i>, written and directed by Indian director and producer Nishtha Jain. Jain is an independent filmmaker working in Bombay, known for her work on social issues through documentaries. In <i>Gulabi Gang</i>, she focuses on the story of the <i>Gulabi Gang</i>, a group of women who travel throughout India demanding gender and caste equality.</p>
                        <p>The film immediately pulls in the viewer with the investigation of a supposed kitchen accident that burned and killed a young, recently married girl. The camera does not hold back in exposing the horror inside the home: a charred figure lying on the ground, hands thrown back and legs spread apart. All the villagers claim it was an accident or suicide, but the Gulabi Gang’s leader Sampat Pal Devi sees through their lies. The next time she visits, the scene has been staged to mimic an accidental fire – a stove placed near the body like a prop. With scenes like this, the film incessantly shows us how a woman’s life can be treated as worthless.</p>
                        <p>From there, the documentary follows the gang on their journey from village to village, as they travel to wherever they are called and needed. Their assistance is sought for a range of issues, from investigating abusive incidents to negotiating how local authorities respond to such incidents. We gradually come to understand how the gang has evolved since its inception in 2006; what started out as a small group fighting against domestic violence has expanded to a women’s revolution that stands against against caste oppression and political corruption.</p>
                        <p>Beautifully shot, the segues between each scene feature the breathtaking wildlife and landscape of Bundelkhand, starkly contrasting with the themes of brutal violence. These intervals serve as a repeated reminder that cruelty and suffering can exist anywhere, even in a place that holds such mesmerizing beauty. In each moment of calm, the viewer holds their breath, waiting for the next hit of harsh reality.</p>
                        <h5>"What started out as a small group fighting against domestic violence has expanded to a women’s revolution that stands against against caste oppression and political corruption."</h5>
                        <p>According to the BBC, an incident of domestic violence is reported in India every five minutes. Through the words of a woman named Husna, the film gives perspective as to why this behaviour is perpetuated and why men defend this abusive conduct. Husna’s sister was killed by her brother for leaving a previous husband to remarry another man she fell in love with. In a one-on-one interview, Husna explains to Jain, who is behind the camera, that if a man feels a woman has done wrong, he is entitled to do as he wishes with her, as tradition dictates that women should not be free to do as they wish. Husna explains that she would defend her male relatives for doing what they can to protect her family’s honour.</p>
                        <p>Jain highlighted this part of the movie in a Q&A session that followed the screening at McGill. She stressed the importance of understanding this mindset in order to change the very roots of India’s patriarchal system. Jain further emphasized that people should watch Gulabi Gang, for while it may not relate to everybody, it raises awareness about the extent of gender inequality in India.</p>
                        <p>While awareness is certainly important, the film does in fact relate to the society we live in half a world away. The failure to question misogynistic beliefs and actions embedded in daily life is a universal quality that allows for oppression to flourish everywhere. One only has to look at the recent case in Montreal, where, according to the Montreal Gazette, the police’s response to cases of sexual assault by taxi drivers was to advise women to “limit their alcohol consumption and stay in control.” Instead of acting to ensure the safety of taxi passengers, the police have put the responsibility on women. The incident mirrors Husna’s message that if women act as they wish, the abuse they may face is their own fault. Misogynistic norms are a transnational problem that needs to be addressed and reflected on critically.</p>
                        <p><i>Gulabi Gang</i> ends on a train platform, brightened with the pink saris of the gang. A bystander asks a member of the gang, “Do you get anything from all this in return?” She shakes her head in response. This subtle ending is one of the only snippets we get of the gang’s exhaustion from their often thankless work. But their courage has not gone without reward. According to Jain, regional policing authorities now recognize the gang as an influential force, and are more likely to respond to their requests.</p>
                        <p>Both the implicit and explicit messages this documentary carries are powerfully thought-provoking. Though the context of the film is upsetting, the awe-inspiring work of the Gulabi Gang, and its brutally honest portrayal by Jain, become a source of inspiration both for women in India and the rest of the world.</p>

                        <p>Po Lazarus is a local four-piece band with a unique sound and a lot of charisma. Their music blends traditional genres in a 21st century setting, such as folk, rock, garage folk, and indie, just to name a few. The group has been cultivating their style and their fanbase for a few years now in Montreal, and in 2014 they released their debut EP. Now, they’re fundraising to record their first LP. The Daily sat down with three members of Po to get the details on the upcoming album, as well as the story behind their name, and their poutine preferences.</p>
                        <p><em>MD:</em> Tell me about yourselves! How did you guys get together?</p>
                        <p><em>Josh (vocals, guitar, ukelele):</em> We all met in CEGEP on the South Shore of Montreal, and we swiftly exchanged musical tastes and picked up guitars, Paul and I specifically, and started writing songs immediately as we learnt the chords.</p>
                        <p><em>MD:</em> Why did you choose the name Po Lazarus?</p>
                        <p><em>Josh:</em> There’s a famous old song called “Po Lazarus” that is a chant or a chain gang song made famous by the O Brother Where Art Thou soundtrack. Great movie. It’s just a song about a criminal named Lazarus who hides up in the mountains while he’s wanted, and eventually the deputies slay him and bring him down the mountain, much like our ultimate demise…</p>
                        <p><em>MD:</em> On your Facebook page it says [that you produce] “anthemic love dirges meant for the Spitbucket.” What does that mean?</p>
                        <p><em>Paul (bass, rhythm guitar):</em> The Spitbucket is actually a location where we create a lot of our music, that’s our jam space on St. Antoine just down the street over here, and I guess we do play some sort of anthemic sort of music. At least in our spirit, we feel as if they are anthems of our lives in a way, and love is a big part of our lives I guess… You know how it is, we’re young men, drinking and loving… and playing music in dirty, dirty places.</p>
                        <p><em>M.O. (drums):</em> I think what could be mundane in life is brought to a more magical level through the lyrics that Josh and Paul write, and that’s part of how we describe ourselves.</p>
                        <p><em>MD:</em> What have you guys been working on?</p>
                        <p><em>Josh:</em> We’re constantly working on the songs, constantly working on our instruments, and very shortly we’re going to be going into the studio and recording our debut album. We’re just practicing to try and have it down perfectly so that we can get into a little trouble in the studio… and I’m sure we will get into trouble!</p>
                        <p><em>MD:</em> Do you guys already know what direction the debut album is going in? Do you guys have a good solid outline? [Right now] you’re kind of a mix of blues, garage, rock…</p>
                        <h4>"“I think what could be mundane in life is brought to a more magical level through the lyrics that Josh and Paul write, and that’s part of how we describe ourselves.”"</h4>
                        <p><em>Paul:</em> Sometimes it’s really hard to put things into words about the band because there are so many varied genres that we incorporate, it’s all very instinct[ive] and innate for us.</p>
                        <p><em>M.O.:</em> I think this album is going to be the birth of that, and then you’ll be able to classify us. But don’t do [it] until then.</p>
                        <p><em>MD:</em> Any major differences between the EP and the debut album?</p>
                        <p><em>Josh:</em> Well I mean the EP is classically what you’re working on, and then you put out an album. It’s going to definitely have many of those elements, it’s sort of eclectic, that EP. We think there’s some triumphs on it, we think there’s some losses, but now we’re very much planning out this album so that it’s gonna be the best it can be for us.</p>
                        <p><em>M.O.:</em> Just recently we were talking about the styles. So there’s one umbrella term that’s “roots rock” and everything is in there – country rock, plain simple rock, heartland rock, folkrock. […] So everything American and in a way Canadian also; tradition[al] rock music I guess – just everything.</p>
                        <p><em>Paul:</em> I don’t think we really know what kind of style that we play ourselves, but we like to play songs that we would like to hear, which are various in genres, and as band members we all listen to different kinds of things, so it results in us not even knowing where to classify ourselves. We kind of do play different genres of songs, so in one show you might see us play a folk country song and also a hard rock song, maybe like an alternative creepy genre that doesn’t even exist yet – ghost rock ‘n’ roll perhaps.</p>
                        <p><em>Josh:</em> Also, we’re glamourous.</p>
                        <p><em>MD:</em> What is it like trying to make it in Montreal?</p>
                        <p><em>Josh:</em> We’re just trying to make the good songs so that they’re there. They’re gonna be there no matter if they’re shit, good – they’re gonna be there, so we’re just trying to make good songs that people relate to and like, and listen to nonstop while they jog, or eat their cereal.</p>
                        <p><em>M.O.:</em> You can have good songs, you can have good musicians, but […] it seems like a lot of the early fans keep coming, and I’m surprised. Because usually you start a band and people come because they’re your friends and then they’re like, oh alright I can stop going now. But they keep coming, and that’s important. So shout out to the fans, to the Po Lazarites.</p>
                        <p><em>MD:</em> In light of poutine week, which is this week: if you could have your own poutine – as a band or individually – what would you name it?</p>
                        <p><em>Josh:</em> Not even gonna make my own special one, it’s all about the Poutineville pogo poutine!</p>
                        <p><em>Paul:</em> Chef Guru curry poutine all the way.</p>
                        <p><em>Josh:</em> We would call it the Po-tine though. There’s vodka on Po-tine as well.</p>
                        <h4>“We’re just trying to make the good songs so that they’re there. They’re gonna be there no matter if they’re shit, good – they’re gonna be there, so we’re just trying to make good songs that people relate to and like, and listen to nonstop while they jog, or eat their cereal.”</h4>
                        <p><em>M.O.:</em> Well I have this recipe and someone can do it at home. Sweet potatoes, it’s beer-battered so you fry that up, and you use the cheese and the gravy but you add some tao chicken in there, with a little bit of soya sauce – that’s gonna be good.</p>
                        <p><em>Paul:</em> I think that question [incited] the most response from us. The one not related to music at all.</p>
                        <p><em>MD:</em> What kind of impact do you want your music to have on your fans?</p>
                        <p><em>Paul:</em> One of sexual excitement.</p>
                        <p><em>MD:</em> Do you want to elaborate?</p>
                        <p><em>Josh:</em> Yes, I’ll elaborate. That’s something just, yes, we’ve achieved that already so – check. But I believe somebody relates to it and listens to it and thinks, maybe they felt the same way if they hear the lyrics and play the piano or play the guitar because they heard a song and they wanna play music too.</p>
                        <p><em>MD:</em> What’s your favourite or most memorable live experience?</p>
                        <p><em>M.O.:</em> Well I usually think we always suck but that’s what makes us good. But we have a few good moments, but that’s when we expect it the least – or maybe that’s just me.</p>
                        <p><em>Paul:</em> I think the favourite stage I’ve ever played on was probably just Josh and I, we played at Burning Man festival like three years ago, that was maybe the greatest place. But as a four-piece band, this bar right here where we’re speaking is maybe one of our best venues. We get nice and sloppy here, we’re comfortable with the bartenders, so it’s always very fun to play here at Grumpy’s. And we put on the best shows I think because we’re so comfortable and just get nice and jammy.</p>
                        <p><em>MD:</em> What motivates you guys to create?</p>
                        <p><em>Paul:</em> Mainly Bob Dylan…we just want to hear more of what we want to listen to. […] an intensity that’s relevant to the emotions we feel: the sadness, the anger, and the happiness.</p>
